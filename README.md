# animus-website
Website project for reading a digital comic from the artist Manoela Costa.

# About the project
Being implemented based off the artist's design, the webpage has a simple script showing images from an array, which is possible to navigate using the keyboard arrow keys, clicking on the left or right edge of the image and the graphic arrows right below the displayd image. 

The website is also fully responsive and optmized for mobile. 

It's currently under construction with the comment section being adapted for the website design and needing some refactoring on the code, also missing aditional content pages that are being prepared by the designer.
